# About this example
This example showcases how you can use the plugin to bundle JavaScript files (but keep it mind that it can be used with many more kinds of files) and set up a live-reloaded development environment with `gulp-connect`.

## Running the example
Just `npm i` (or `npm install`) into this folder and then either run:

- `npm run start` to run `gulp-connect`, or
- `npm run build` to generate production bundles.
